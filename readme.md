# My MCP Server

My MCP Server is a lightweight server implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) built using Node.js and TypeScript. MCP is an open standard that enables secure, two-way connections between AI-powered applications and external data sources, making it easier to integrate context into your AI systems [&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}][&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}].

## Overview

This project is a simple yet extendable MCP server that implements core MCP primitives such as Prompts, Resources, and Tools. Itâ€™s designed to provide a standardized interface for AI systems to access external data securely and efficiently. The server uses TypeScript for improved type safety and maintainability, making it an excellent starting point for building robust MCP integrations.

## Features

- **Secure Communication**: Follows best practices for secure, two-way data exchange.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable to support additional endpoints or integrations.
- **Logging & Debugging**: Detailed logging of LLM interactions for traceability and audit purposes.
- **TypeScript-Based**: Written in TypeScript to provide enhanced code quality and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or later.
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: Installed as a project dependency.
